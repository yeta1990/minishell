###### INFILES #######
<infile does nothing
in <infile | cat, cat doesn't receive any content nor redirection



###### OUTFILEs ######

>outfile creates an empty file
>outfile >outfile2 creates two empty files

<infile >outfile creates the file adios but empty, although infile isn't empty
<infile >outfile >outfile2 creates two empty files
<infile_wrong >outfile doesn't create anything, only shows an error "No such file or directory"

<infile command (ex. cat) >outfile creates or replaces outfile with the output of the command
<infile command >outfile1 >outfile2 creates two files, but output of the command is only sent to last outfile!


###### HEREDOC #######

<< EOF opens stdin until EOF is exactly written in a line
<< EOF cat shows all lines except for EOF, after writting EOF
<< EOF <infile cat opens stdin, but doesn't do anything with that string received, cat only gets "infile" content.
<< EOF << EFF cat opens two times stdin, but cat only receives the last string
<< cat | wc -l opens stdin but nothing is sent to pipe

########## Works:
<1 <2 cat >out4 << EOF | cat
echo hola | <1 <2 cat >out4 << EOF | cat

######### 'm going to wait until our builtin is ready to test again...

<1 <2 cat >out4 << EOF | echo hola -> it prints "hola" in the heredoc. as we have to rewrite the "echo" builtin, I'm going to wait until our builtin is ready to test again...hopefully it will work
