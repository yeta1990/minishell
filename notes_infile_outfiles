###### INFILES #######
<infile does nothing
in <infile | cat, cat doesn't receive any content nor redirection



##### OUTFILEs ######

>outfile creates an empty file
>outfile >outfile2 creates two empty files

<infile >outfile creates the file adios but empty, although infile isn't empty
<infile >outfile >outfile2 creates two empty files
<infile_wrong >outfile doesn't create anything, only shows an error "No such file or directory"

<infile command (ex. cat) >outfile creates or replaces outfile with the output of the command
<infile command >outfile1 >outfile2 creates two files, but output of the command is only sent to last outfile!
